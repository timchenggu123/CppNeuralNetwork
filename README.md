# CppNeuralNetwork

A basic SGD neural network model written in C++ using Visual Studio 2017 and (loosely) based on this script https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.git. Helper functions that helps read MNIST files are included as well.

I created this program in order to gain a better understanding of SGD neural network for myself. As of the time this document is created, the network fully functions but each epoch takes few hours to complete (depending on your machine). I will be optimizing the performance in the future. I will also add more comments in the future as well.
